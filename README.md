# The VBA of Wall Street
## Summary
* A homework assignment for UC Berkeley's Data Analytics Bootcamp
* Visual Basic Script loops through three years of stock price data for several companies
* The script calculates metrics like total volume, annual change in dollar value, and annual percentage change in dollary value for each of the stocks across all three years
* The script also locates the stocks with the greatest annual percentage increases in value, greatest annual percentage decreases in value, and greatest total annual volumes
### Files
* The Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx file in the "Resources" folder is the stock data used in this analysis
* The financial_analysis_scripts.vbs is the Visual Basic Script file that can be used with the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx file to answer the questions listed in the instructions below
## Stock Market Analysis (Homework Assignment Instructions)
### Easy
* Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year

   * The total Volume of the stock
   * Ticker symbol

### Hard
* Your solution will include everything from the moderate challenge
* Your solution will also be able to locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume"
### Challenge
* Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once
